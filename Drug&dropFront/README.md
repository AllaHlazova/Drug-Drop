# DrugDrop

## Description
This application displays the work of Drug & Drop. For the backend, node js express 
server is written. Was created route “films” upon request for which you can get a list 
of films in json format. Data comes to the boxes in an http request from node js express 
server. The list of movies and Drug & Drop are implemented using Angular Material. To style 
the application, I used SCSS. The following libraries were used in the project: Angular 8.3.0, 
RxJS 6.4.0, Bootstrap 4.3.1, Angular Material 8.2.1, Express 4.16.1.
